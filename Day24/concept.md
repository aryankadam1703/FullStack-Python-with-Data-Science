# Lambda Functions - a functions without name is called as lambda functions
    - nameless functions
    - does not return any values
    - single line of code
    - easy to implement, developement
    - used only for expression, not for statements and loops
    - provide less readability
        eg:- def add():
                a= 10
                b= 20
                c = a + b
                print(c)

1. syntax - 
    lambda arguments : expression

    example 
    a = lambda a=10,b=20 : a+b
    print(a())

# Advantage and disadvantages of lambda functions 
    1. Advantages
        - It contains single line of code 
        - it is nameless function- a function without name
        - it is used in Higher Order Function.
        - Useful for Short-Term Needs
        - Improves Readability
        - easy to implement
        - functional programming used
        - used only for expression and not for loops and statements
        - quick customization and behaviour
        - Memory Efficiency
        - appliciable for many languages 

    2. Disadvantages
        - limitated to a single expression
        - reduced readability
        - No statements and control statements
        - hard to reused
        - limitated used in object oriented programming.
        - cant handle muliple statements
