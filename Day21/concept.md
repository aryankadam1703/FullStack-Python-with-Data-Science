# Types of functions
   1. Built-in :- predefined functions readily available for use.
   2. User Defined Funcctions :- Reuseable code written by user to perform specific task

# define and call

# Advantages of functions
1. Code Reusability - You can call one functions any no of times and anywhere in a program
2. Modularity - large programs are divided into functions
3. Avoid Code Duplications
4. Code organization and Redability
5. Easier Debugging
6. Saves Time
7. Flexible with parameters
